💡 What is BharatLaw?
A smart AI assistant that helps you understand Indian laws just by asking questions in normal, everyday language — no legal jargon needed!

🔧 How does it work?
🧠 We trained a small but powerful AI model called Qwen-0.5B (from Alibaba).
📚 Then we fine-tuned it using a custom dataset full of informal legal queries and their correct legal interpretations.

🧑‍⚖️ Now, it can:
Understand casual/legal questions like "Can my boss fire me without notice?"
Reply with relevant acts, sections, and easy explanations.

👥 Built for common people, not just lawyers!
💻 Lightweight – runs fast and doesn’t need heavy computing power

🌟 Real-world use cases:
🙋‍♂️ Students asking about their rights
💼 Employees checking labor laws
🏠 Tenants clarifying rental agreements
👵 Elderly understanding pension or family law

Think of BharatLaw as your friendly neighborhood legal chatbot – built in India, for India! 🇮🇳
